To run the Jupyter Notebook, please follow these steps: 

1) Check if the modules are properly loaded. To do that run


`source /cvmfs/software.eessi.io/versions/2023.06/init/bash`

2) Go to `/rsc-plugins/ansible/jupyter` and run `./run.sh`
If there is no output, run `chmod +x run.sh` and try running the previours command again


3) Once the module is loaded, you will see similar output in your terminal to this:
